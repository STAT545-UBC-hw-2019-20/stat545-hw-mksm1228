## **Exercise 1: Explain the Value of the ```here::here``` Package**

---------------------------------------------------------

- ```here::here``` can construct paths to your project's files. It can detect the root directory at the time when the package is loaded. This makes it easier to use sub-directories within projects because you only need to specify the path from the root to the sub-directory and not the entire path.

- Thus,```here::here``` allows other users to open and run your code from their own computer because the paths created by ```here::here``` are platform-independent. In addition, once the path has been set, ```here::here``` will work regardless of where the local copy is stored for the other person making it very robust.

## **Exercise 2: Factor Management**

-------------------------------------

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
str(gapminder)
```
- Using str(), we can see the data type each variable is associated with. In addition, we can see that there are 1704 rows of observations.
- Since for this task we are interested in dropping Oceania, we will focus on the continent variable. It is a factor with 5 levels. Let's look at what the 5 levels are.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
levels(gapminder$continent)
```
- Using levels(), we can see the names of the 5 levels for the Continent factor. 
- Before removing Oceania, let us see how many rows of observations it contains by filtering it out and then using nrow().

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Oceania") %>%
  nrow() 
```

- As shown above, Oceania contains 24 rows of observations. From this, we know we will be succesful in dropping Oceania when the new data set has 24 less rows of observations. 

### **Dropping Oceania**

--------------------------------------

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
oceaniagone <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania")

oceaniagone2 <- oceaniagone %>% # Putting this into a new variable because the drop isn't saving
                  droplevels() 
```

- I filtered out all the continents that were not Oceania and put them into a new variable called "oceaniagone."
- Next, I used the droplevels() to drop all unused levels in both country and continent.
- I put all of this into a new variable "oceaniagone2" because from my testing, the drop does not save unless I put it into a new variable.
- Now let's compare the gapminder data set to my oceaniagone2 data set.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  str()

oceaniagone2 %>%
  str() 

levels(oceaniagone2$continent)
```

- I used str() on both the original gapminder data set and the oceaniagone2 data set for comparison.
- We can see that the oceaniagone2 data set has:
  - 24 less rows of observations,
  - 2 less country levels,
  - and 1 less continent level. 
- We can also see that Oceania is gone when we use levels() on the continents of oceaniagone2. Thus we were able to drop Oceania and all unused factor levels. 

### **Reordering the levels of ```continent```**

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
oceaniagone2 %>%
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, gdpPercap, min)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap, fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10("GDP per capita (US$)", labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("GDP Per Capita (US$)") + xlab("Continent")
```

- I created a boxplot to evaluate the spread of GDP Per Capita within the oceaniagone2 data set.
- Here, I used the fct_reorder() to reorder the continents by the min GDP Per Cap.
- Africa had the smallest min GDP Per Cap while America had the largest min GDP Per Cap
- We can verify this worked by producing a table with the min GDP Per Cap for the oceaniagone2 data set.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
oceaniagone2 %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(min_gdpPercap = min(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(min_gdpPercap) %>%
  kable(., format = "html", caption = 
  "Min GDP Per Capita for each Continent")%>%
  kable_styling()
```

- When we compare the order of the continents between the table and the figure above, we can see that fct_reorder() worked.
- Let's see what the order of the continents looks like when we reorder by max GDP Per Cap.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
oceaniagone2 %>%
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, gdpPercap, max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap, fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_y_log10("GDP per capita (US$)", labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("GDP Per Capita (US$)") + xlab("Continent")
```

- Here, I used the fct_reorder() to reorder the continents by the max GDP Per Cap.
- As a result, Africa has the smallest max GDP Per Cap and Asia has the largest max GDP Per Cap.
- To verify this, let's create a table that looks at the max GDP Per Cap for each continent. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
oceaniagone2 %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(max_gdpPercap = max(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(max_gdpPercap) %>%
  kable(., format = "html", caption = 
  "Max GDP Per Capita for each Continent")%>%
  kable_styling()
```

- The order of the continents between the table and figure are the same, verifying that our fct_reorder() worked.

## **Exercise 3: File Input/Output (I/O)**

-----------------------------------------------

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gap_gdppercap <- gapminder %>%
                    filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
                    group_by(country) %>%
                    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap), digits = 2)
write_csv(gap_gdppercap, "gap_gdppercap.csv")
```

- I wrote a new .csv file that summarizes the mean GDP Per Capita for countries in Asia and put this into a variable called "gap_gdppercap". 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
write_csv(gap_gdppercap, here("hw05", "Input Exercise", "exported_gap_gdppercap.csv"))
```

- I used here() to specify the path for the file. The next file is now contained in the hw05 folder in a subfolder named "Input Exercise."
- To demonstrate this path works, I renamed the .csv file to "exported_gap_gdppercap.csv."
- Next, I am going to read the file in using read_csv().

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_csv(here("hw05", "Input Exercise", "exported_gap_gdppercap.csv")) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(mean_gdpPercap, country))+
  geom_point(color = "dark blue")+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_log10("GDP Per Capita (US$)", labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  ylab("Countries in Asia")+
  
  ggtitle("Average GDP Per Capita for Countries in Asia")
```

- I plotted GDP Per Cap versus Country and we can see that the file was read properly using read_csv() and here().
- But it is difficult to read this graph because R lists the countries in alphabetical order. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_csv(here("hw05", "Input Exercise", "exported_gap_gdppercap.csv")) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(mean_gdpPercap, fct_reorder(country, mean_gdpPercap)))+
  geom_point(color = "dark blue")+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_log10("GDP Per Capita (US$)", labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  ylab("Countries in Asia")+
  ggtitle("Average GDP Per Capita Recorded for Countries in Asia")
  
```

- I used fct_reorder() to reorder the countries from lowest average GDP Per Capita to highest average GDP Per Capita
- Now we can see that Myanmar had the lowest average GDP Per Cap and Kuwait had the highest average GDP Per Cap.
- Overall, the created file survived the round trip of writing to file then reading it back in.

## **Exercise 4: Visualization Design**

-----------------------------------------------

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
oldplot <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, country) %>%
  summarize(n_countries = n_distinct(country)) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(continent, n_countries))+
  geom_col(fill = "orange")+
  ggtitle("Number of Countries in Each Continent")+
  ylab("Country Count")+
  xlab("Continent")+
  theme_bw()

newplot <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, country) %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(country)) %>%
  tally(n) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(fct_reorder(continent, n, .desc = TRUE), n, fill = continent, 
  legend = FALSE))+
  geom_col()+
  geom_text(aes(label = n), size = 4,  vjust=-0.40)+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("")+
  ggtitle("Number of Countries in Each Continent")+
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.background = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
  axis.title.y=element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank(), 
  axis.ticks.y=element_blank(), 
  legend.position = "none") # I learned how to edit the elements of the figure from http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-themes-and-background-colors-the-3-elements

plot_grid(oldplot, newplot, ncol = 2) # I got this package from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1249548/side-by-side-plots-with-ggplot2
```

- The figure on the left was taken from hw02 and the figure on the right is the recreation of the same figure using the principles of effective graphs. 
- I removed the background and grid lines as well as the redundant labels.
- Each continent is now represented by it's own colour rather than sharing the same colour as the other continents.
- The number of countries within the continent were added onto the new graph. In the previous version, it was difficult to identify the actual number of countries in the continent.
- Finally, I rearranged the order the continents to go from largest number of countries to smallest number of countries. 
- I think the changes I made present the figure in a much more effective manner. I removed a lot of redundant elements and included some visualization features such as including the number of the countries for each continent. This really presents the message of the figure in a more attractive and impactful manner.

## **Exercise 5: Writing Figures to File**

----------------------------------------

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggsave("oldplot.png", plot = oldplot, width = 4, height = 6, scale = 1)
ggsave("newplot.png", plot = newplot, width = 5, height = 6, scale = 2) 
```
- I used ggsave to save the old and new version of the figure from hw02 into a .png.
- I played around with the width, height, and scale argument. 
- Now I am going to put the images directly onto my report. Using the following code ```![Alt Text](/path/to/img.png)```

![Old Country Count Plot](oldplot.png)
![New Country Count Plot](newplot.png)
