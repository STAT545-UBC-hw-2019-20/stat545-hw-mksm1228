## **STAT545A Homework Assignment 03 README**

------------------------------------------

For homework assignment 03, task options 2, 3, and 4 were chosen. Below contains more description about what the actual tasks were. Also, for the first time, we were asked to make a HTML file output viewable as a webpage. To do so, I had to use Github pages. To access the webpage of homework assignment 03 [please click here.](https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-mksm1228/hw03/hw03_dplyr-ggplot2.html) *Note: the text used to put the figures and tables side-by-side do not render properly for the .md file. Regardless, I made both the .rmd and .md files as github outputs.*

### **Task Option 2**

------------------------------------------

Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

### **Task Option 3**

------------------------------------------

Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

### **Task Option 4**

------------------------------------------
