## **STAT545A Homework Assignment 03 README**

------------------------------------------

In this folder you will find the files for homework assignment 03 which was due on Oct 1, 2019 at 23:59. Currently, it contains the .rmd and .md file as well as the html links for the figures. 

For homework assignment 03, task options 2, 3, and 4 were chosen. For each task, we were supposed to produce:
1. a tibble, using ```dplyr``` as our data manipulation tool
2. an accompanying plot of data from the tibble, using ```ggplot2``` as our visualization tool 
3. some dialogue about what the tables/figures show 

Below contains more description about what the actual tasks were. Also, for the first time, we were asked to make a HTML file output viewable as a webpage. To do so, I had to use Github pages. To access the webpage of homework assignment 03 [please click here.](https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-mksm1228/hw03/hw03_dplyr-ggplot2.html) *Note: the text used to put the figures and tables side-by-side do not render properly for the .md file but work for the webpage. Regardless, I made both the .rmd and .md files as github outputs to make it more readable.*

### **Task Option 2**

------------------------------------------

Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

### **Task Option 3**

------------------------------------------

Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

### **Task Option 4**

------------------------------------------

Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean.
