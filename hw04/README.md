There were 3 exercises in this homework assignment. For Exercise 1 and 2, we were asked to:

1. Put data in wider format.
2. Produce a plot of the wide format. 
3. Relengthen the wider data.

In addition, we were asked to choose one of two variants for each exercise. Univariate Option 1 was chosen for Exercise 1 and Multivariate Option 1 was chosen for Exercise 2. More details about the variant tasks are posted below. 

### Exercise 1: Univariate Option 1

---------------------------------------

1. Make a tibble with one row per year, and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.
2. Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.
3. Re-lengthen the data.

### Exercise 2: Multivariate Option 1

---------------------------------------

1. Make a tibble with one row per year, and columns for life expectancy and GDP per capita (or two other numeric variables) for two or more countries.
2. Re-lengthen the data.

### Exercise 3: Table Joins

----------------------------------------

For Exercise 3, we were asked to:
1. For each guest in the guestlist (```guest``` tibble), add a column for email address, which can be found in the ```email``` tibble.
2. Find who we have emails for, yet are not on the guestlist.
3. Make a guestlist that includes everyone we have emails for in addition to those on the original guestlist.
